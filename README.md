# ECSE420_Project
To run this project on your machine, you will need to install Ray, an open-source unified compute framework. You can follow the instruction on this website https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-overview/installation.html. Note that since Ray is still in Beta for windows support, the code was implemented on MacOs.

Once Ray in installed, run the command python or python3 <file name>.
